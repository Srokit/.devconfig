# Configuration for dev work. 

Clone this repo to home dir and run setup.sh.

## Setup

Running setup.sh will create the symlinks for the config files that need to be
in the home dir.

## Compatibilty across devices

Each of the configuration files is aware of which device the scripts are run on
and include the necessary private scripts as apporiate such as work specific
code.
